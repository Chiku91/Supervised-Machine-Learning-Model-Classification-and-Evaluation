🎯 This project showcases two core supervised machine learning tasks:
1. 🌸 **Iris Flower Classification** using algorithms like SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and more.
2. 🏦 **Loan Approval Prediction** using logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.

## 📁 Files Included

- `iris classification(Exp3).ipynb` – Iris classification notebook
- `loan approval(Exp4).ipynb` – Loan approval prediction notebook
- `Iris.csv` – Dataset for iris classification
- `loan_data_set.csv` – Dataset for loan prediction


## 🌸 Iris Classification

🧪 The Iris dataset is a classic multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher. This model classifies flowers into:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

**Algorithms used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes

📈 Accuracy scores and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the models.

## 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction

💼 Predict whether a loan application will be approved based on user financial and demographic data.

**Key Features:**
- Gender, Marital Status, Education, ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount
- Label: Loan_Status (Y/N)

**Algorithms used:**
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

🔍 The model helps financial institutions automate and optimize approval workflows.
